      <br>
      <p class="fw-bold lead">ISOLVIT GENERAL PRIVACY POLICY</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">isolvIT, Inc., and our subsidiaries and affiliates ("isolvIT" or "we") respect your preferences concerning the treatment of Personal Information that we may collect. This policy lets you know how we collect and use your Personal Information, how you can control its use, and describes our practices regarding information collected from the different isolvIT sites that link or refer to this policy (such as our websites, computer or mobile software applications, social media pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages), as well as through offline sales and marketing activities (collectively, the "Channels").</p>
    
      <p class="lh-lg">The Channels may provide links to or the ability to connect with non-isolvIT websites, services, social networks or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share information about you. Those third-party websites or services are beyond our control. We encourage you to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-isolvIT websites or services before providing your Personal Information to them.</p>
      <br>

Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, your name, physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, company affiliation and associated interests.</p>

        In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information, such as combining a precise geographical location with your name. If we combine Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Personal Information:</p>
    
      <p class="lh-lg">isolvIT uses and shares the Personal Information it collects (unless otherwise restricted by applicable law), to: </p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Other Information:</p>
    
      <p class="lh-lg">We may use, transfer, and disclose Other Information we collect for any purpose, except where applicable law requires otherwise. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we will only use it in the same way that we are permitted to use and disclose Personal Information. </p>

      <br>



      <p class="fw-bold lead">HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION</p>
    
      <p class="lh-lg">isolvIT and our third party service providers may collect both Personal Information and Other Information from a variety of sources that generally fall into three categories:</p>
        
      <p class = "fw-bold">Direct Interactions:</p> 

      <p class="lh-lg">From your use of and interaction with us through the Channels and other activities such as account creation, submission of registrations and forms, or sales inquiries and transactions.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Publicly Available Data / Data from Third Parties:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">Other data you may have made publicly available, such as social media posts, or data provided by third party sources, such as marketing opt-in lists, or data aggregators.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Automated Interactions:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">From the use of technologies such as electronic communication protocols, cookies, embedded URLs orpixels, or widgets, buttons and tools. Although isolvIT's use of Automated Interactions may change over time as technology evolves, the following descriptions are designed to provide you with additional detail about isolvIT's current approach to information collected from Automated Interactions.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Electronic Communications Protocols:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">As is true when you visit most Sites, isolvIT may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), your IP address (which may identify your general geographic location or company), and date and time.</p>

      <p class = "lh-lg">isolvIT may also automatically receive and record information about your interaction with the Channels, such as clickstream information (when each isolvIT webpage was visited and how much time was spent on the page), or general geo-location data.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Cookies:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">isolvIT's server will query your browser to see if there are "cookies" previously set by our electronic Channels. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to store on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. Cookies may collect information, including a unique identifier, user preferences, profile information, membership information, and general usage and volume statistical information. Cookies may also be used to collect individualized web site use data, provide electronic Channel personalization, or conduct and measure the effectiveness of advertising in accordance with this Policy.</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">Some cookies may remain on users' computers after they leave the Website. While the majority are set to expire within 1-24 months of your last visit to the website that set the cookie, others may not expire because of their nature, like cookies that remember opt-out preferences.

        Your browser may provide you with information and control over cookies. You can set your browser to alert you when a cookie is being used, and accept or reject the cookie. You can also set your browser to refuse all cookies or accept only cookies returned to the originating servers. Users can generally disable the cookie feature on their browser without affecting their ability to use the site, except in some cases where cookies are used as an essential security feature necessary for transaction completion. Cookies, however, are important to the proper functioning of a site, and disabling them may degrade your experience and interfere with Web site features and customizations.</p>
      
      <p class="fw-bold">Embedded URLs:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">isolvIT may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the electronic Channels without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Channels, but are not associated with Personal Information and are not used beyond the session.</p>
      
      <p class="fw-bold">Widgets, Buttons, and Tools:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">Our electronic Channels may include widgets, which are interactive mini-programs that run on our site to provide specific services from another company (e.g., links to bookmarked sites), along with buttons or other tools that link to other companies' services (e.g., a "Like" button or third party map). The widget, button or tool may collect and automatically send Personal Information, such as your e-mail address, or Other Information (such as your browser information, or IP address), to a third party. Cookies may also be set or used by the widgets, buttons or tools to enable them to function properly or for other purposes, which may include advertising. Information collected or used by a widget, button or tool, including cookie settings and preferences, is governed by the privacy policy of the company that created it.</p>

      <p class="fw-bold">Physical Location:</p>

      <p class="lh-lg">We may collect the physical location of your device and use it to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device's location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.</p>

      <br>




    <p class="fw-bold lead">REGISTRATION, PREFERENCES, AND OPT-OUT</p>

    
    <p class="fw-bold">Prenerences and Opt-Out</p>

    <br>


    <p class="fw-bold"> E-mail Marketing:</p>

    <p class="lh-lg"> isolvIT enables you to opt out of marketing communications. You may opt out of e-mail marketing by modifying your online profile as described above or by using our general unsubscribe automated link that is included in isolvIT marketing e-mails. If you have any problems using this opt-out mechanism, please send an email to info@isolvit.net -- indicate "opt-out" in the subject line, and specify what problem you have encountered in the body of the message.</p>

    <p class="lh-lg">Some non-marketing communications are not subject to general opt-out, such as communications related to product download, sales transactions, software updates and other support related information, patches and fixes, conferences or events for which you have registered, disclosures to comply with legal requirements, and (where permitted by law) quality assurance surveys. Some additional communications with partners are also not subject to general-opt out, including product alerts, updates, contractual marketing and sales materials, and other notices related to partner status.</p>

    <p class="fw-bold"> Third Party Permission-Based Lists:</p>

    <p class="lh-lg"> On occasion, isolvIT may use third-party lists to send communications about isolvIT products and services. These lists, which are maintained by third parties, include users eligible under applicable law to receive e-mails from other companies such as isolvIT. When we use such lists, the communications will include mechanisms to opt out of receiving isolvIT marketing communications. If you have trouble opting out, or if you wish to make us aware of any issues related to a third-party mailing, you may contact us directly through our inquiry form.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="fw-bold"> Access, Correction, and Profile Updates</p>

    <p class="lh-lg">You may request to review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise modify any of your Personal Information that you have previously provided to us through the Channels, or object to the use or processing of such Personal Information by us..

In such cases, issues will be addressed, or you will be contacted regarding the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps, within thirty days. </p>
   
    <p class="fw-bold">Advertising</p>

    <p class="lh-lg"> isolvIT uses some third parties to administer a limited set of isolvIT advertisements on its Web sites. No personal information is provided to the advertisers as part of this process, but aggregate profile information, may be used in the selection of advertising to make sure that it has relevance to the user. On some banner ads, an embedded pixel may be present, and while it does not associate with a cookie or other personal profile information, it may return session connection information that allows advertisers to better determine how many individual users have clicked on the ad banner.</p>

    <p class="fw-bold">Security</p>

    <p class="lh-lg"> 
        The security of your Personal Information is very important to isolvIT. We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards that are designed to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

        In addition, isolvIT uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details.

    <p class="lh-lg">In the event that your Personal Information is acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an unauthorized person and applicable law requires notification, isolvIT will notify you by e-mail, fax, or U.S. mail. isolvIT will give you notice promptly, consistent with the reasonable needs of law enforcement and/or isolvIT to determine the scope of the breach and to investigate and restore the integrity of the data system.</p>
