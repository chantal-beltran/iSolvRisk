            <p class = "lh-lg"> The story of iSolvRisk unfolded during a chance meeting on a basketball court at St. John's University in 2017. Joe met Nekayle at the recreational center. After Nekayle suggested that Joe switch into his major, Risk Management and Insurance, Joe eagerly switched into the major. The two reconnected in 2020, the year Joe told Nekayle about an idea in a notebook he had.

Since the inception of the company, the team has grown from a humble group of 3 into a powerhouse of 20+ professionals. Boasting expertise from Fortune 500 executives to skilled designers, developers, and industry professionals, the origins of iSolvRisk is a testament to a business that started from a bond on the basketball court and is seizing opportunities to rewrite the narrative of risk management and education.
